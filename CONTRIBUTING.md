# Contributing

Take a look at the open issues and pull requests to see open tasks.
You are more than welcome to contribute any PR regardless if it's listed or not.

## Workflow

- the `master`-branch is protected, so no commits can be pushed directly to it
- please create a new PR for any proposed changes
- **use the issue and PR templates**
  - [Create a bug report](https://github.com/CodeLionX/actordb/issues/new?template=bug_report_template.md)
  - [Ask a question or file an issue](https://github.com/CodeLionX/actordb/issues/new?template=issue_template.md)
- each branch must have one of the following prefixes:
  - `fix/` for bug fixes and small, urgent changes
  - `feature/` for new feature proposals
  - `doc/` for changes that only affect documentational files and **no source code**
  - `refactor/` for refactorings that do not introduce new features or just few
